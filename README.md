# RopeV2
Another attempt on RopeMC
This version of Rope is still using a javaagent and the instrumentation api, but doesn't use the old wrapper system anymore.
Instead now we have an api and an implementation for each supported version. As for now we only support 1.14.4.
A more detailed readme will be added soon.
